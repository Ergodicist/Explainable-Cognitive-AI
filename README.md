**Weight-Calculative AI Architecture** is a new-generation artificial intelligence framework based on the "Weight-Calculativism" cognitive theory. Starting from the first principles of cognitive science, it reconstructs human cognitive and decision-making processes through three core pillars: **logical atoms, pointing and comparison operations, and transparent weight calculation**, forming a theoretical model with fundamental explainability and value alignment potential. 

The project outlines a concrete engineering pathway—through **hierarchical cognitive library construction, graph-algorithm-driven symbolic computation, global workspace scheduling, and hybrid decision-making mechanisms**—to transform this theoretical vision into a buildable, verifiable, and scalable software system. Currently in the stage of theoretical exposition and conceptual validation, it includes two basic demonstration models that showcase core decision logic and cognitive workflows.

**We welcome researchers, engineers, and thinkers to join this open exploration—to collaborate, build, and evolve this architecture together toward transparent, value-aligned, and human-compatible general intelligence.**
